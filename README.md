Small medical imaging project in Breast Cancer Histology Multi-classification with ResNet18

Using the BACH dataset we will develop a machine learning model that distinguishes between normal breast tissue and carcinoma. Our dataset contains the following:

* Normal: 100
* Benign: 100
* in situ carcinoma: 100
* Invasive carcinoma: 100

It can be found and downloaded here:
